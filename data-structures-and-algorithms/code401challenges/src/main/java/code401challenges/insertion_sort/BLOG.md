## According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort#targetText=Insertion%20sort%20is%20a%20simple,,%20heapsort,%20or%20merge%20sort.)  

**Insertion sort** is a simple **sorting** algorithm that builds the final **sorted** array (or list) one item at a time.
Insertion sort [iterates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iteration "Iteration"), consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

 It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort
