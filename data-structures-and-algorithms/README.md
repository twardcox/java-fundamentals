# Data Structures & Algorithms File Structure for Code 401: JavaThis repo shows the expected file structure for Code 401: Java data structures & algorithms. The command `gradle init --type java-library` was run inside of the `code401challenges` directory, and that `code401challenges` directory is the root from which I open IntelliJ.This root README is where the links to daily work live.## Week 1 Challenges## [Day 1: Reverse an Array](./code401challenges/src/main/java/code401challenges/ArrayReverse.java)    ## Paired Programming Partner* Peter Lee  ### Challenge Summary  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.    #### Challenge Description  Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.    #### Approach & Efficiency  We took the iterate through and replace approach. We have not covered Big O time yet.    #### Solution  ![Alt text](./assets/array_reverse.jpg?raw=true 'Reverse Array')    ## [Day 2: Shift an Array](./code401challenges/src/main/java/code401challenges/ArraryShift.java)  ## Paired Programming Partner* Kevin Couture  ### Challenge Summary  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.    #### Challenge Description  Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.    #### Approach & Efficiency  We chose to create a new array and iterate over old inserting into the new. We have not covered Big O time yet.    #### Solution  ![Alt text](./assets/array_shift.jpg?raw=true 'Shift Array')  ## [Day 3: Binary Search](./code401challenges/src/main/java/code401challenges/BinarySearch.java)## Paired Programming Partner* Melfi Perez    ### Challenge Summary  Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.    #### Challenge Description  Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array’s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.    #### Approach & Efficiency  * First attempt used recursion but required the use of a built in function.   * we got close on the second attempt but needed to do some research online.  * https://dzone.com/articles/binary-searching-in-java-without-recursion    #### Solution  ![Alt text](./assets/binary_search.jpg?raw=true 'Binary Search')    ## [Day 6: Linked List](./code401challenges/src/main/java/linkedList/LinkedList.java)    ## Co-Conspirators  * Melfi Perez  * Matt Stuhring  * Nicholas Paro  * Jack Kinne        ### Challenge Summary    Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure        #### Challenge Description    * Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.    * Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.    * utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge.    * .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list    * .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node    * .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node                #### Approach & Efficiency    * Generated the proper file structure;    * Created the class;    * implemented methods of the class including a class constructor;    * generated tests as I developed.          #### Solution      * append      ![append](./assets/append.jpg?raw=true 'append')            * insert After      ![append](./assets/insertAfter.jpg?raw=true 'append')            * insert Before      ![append](./assets/insertBefore.jpg?raw=true 'append')            # Challenge Summary      Use the LinkedList class to return the k-th value from the end.            ## Challenge Description       Use the LinkedList class to return the k-th value from the end.            ## Approach & Efficiency      We save each node value into an ArrayList then did the math to find the correct index and returned that value.            ## Solution      ![append](./assets/kthFromEnd.jpg?raw=true 'append')
