# Reverse an Array

This is the first code challenge of the 401 course. And my first real java method.

## Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency

Both solutions to this problem were white boarded with myself and Peter Lee. My approach is to create a new array then iterate over the original backwards placing the values into the new array forwards.

## Solution
